tpmrnd

tpmrnd is a daemon that periodically writes entropy from the TPM to
the host PRNG. It supports the following flags:

	-b bytes	Select the size of the chunk of random data.
			The default is 256 bytes.

	-f		Run in the foreground (do not daemonise).

	-h		Print a short usage message.

	-s seconds	Specify the update period in seconds. Default
	                is 21600 seconds (six hours).

Messages are written to syslog if tpmrnd is running as a daemon, or to
the console if it is running in the foreground.

make && sudo make install
```
